	So far I have gotten this program to work when there are non-overlapping snapshots. The program takes about a minute to run because it sleeps in order to establish all connections and also sleeps/receives mutliple times after the end of parsing the command file. Furthermore, each process also waits until it knows that the other processes are done as well. 
	I'm not sure if it's worth attempting to address multiple snapshots and risk spending a day or two extra on it while accruing the penalty, and there's no guarantee that I will figure it out, so I'm deciding to turn it in now. My apologies for the inconvenience, but I also have other projects that are due this week that I have to start on :/ Hope it's not too much of an inconvenience for grading.
